# Project 5

1. Fit a pytorch model to the oasis data that treats gold lesions as the outcome and T2 value as the predictor. Use a bias term, sigmoid output activation function and no hidden layers. Do not split the data into a testing and training dataset. Demonstrate that the fitted values are the same as those obtained with logistic regression.  

2. Fit a pytorch neural network with two hidden layers on the diamond dataset from the previous project predicting price. Evaluate your predictions on held out test set data.
